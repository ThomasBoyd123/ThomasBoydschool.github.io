	<h1>Salem</h1>
    <p>Salem is a beautiful city in Oregon with a rich history. Not to be confused with Salem, Massachusets. Salem is actually the name of the capital of Oregon. Salem is the second largest city after Portland with a population of 174,365 in 2019. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government_of_Oregon" target="_blank">State of Oregon</a> is also the largest public employer in the city which would make sense regarding the fact that it is the state's capital. Salem is also nicknamed the "cherry city" for the amount of cherries they produce and their love for agriculture.</p>
