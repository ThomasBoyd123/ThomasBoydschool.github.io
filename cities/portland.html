	<h1>Portland</h1>
    <p>Portland is the largest city in Oregon and has the second highest population in the Pacific Northwest only beaten by Seattle. Specific things to do in Portland are to visit the Columbia River Gorge, the Oregon Coast, or simply Downtown Portland. The Columbia River Gorge is a huge attraction with there being many different tours, air tours, and hiking spots. Like most downtown urban environments there are many gourmet restaurants are quality entertainment for the night life. Portland sticks out from the rest as it isn't to densly populated and the environment mixed with the air quality gives it more of a refreshing atmosphere compared to other downtown spots.</p>
