    <h2 id="about">About Oregon</h2>
    <p>Oregon is a beautiful state with most of its influx of tourists coming to see what beautiful nature can be found in Oregon. one of the most well known and revered national parks has to be <a href="https://www.nps.gov/crla/index.htm" target="_blank">Crater Lake National Park</a>. Crater Lake is by far one of Oregon's most visited national parks. Crater Lake was formed by a now-collapsed volcano. This volcano is Mount Mazama. Crater Lake is also the fifth-oldest national park in the United States.</p>
    <p>Besides the national parks another beautiful place that encompasses nature would be the beach. <a href="https://www.cannonbeach.org/" target="_blank">Cannon Beach</a> is a beautiful place that really shows the fantastic coastline Oregon has to offer. The beach is well known for it's amazing restaurants and for the puffins that appear at Haystack Rock. Cannon Beach has beautiful waters and wonderful seaside activities for everyone.</p>
    <p>However if you aren't a fan of the ocean or nature walks you can always go to <a href="https://www.fs.usda.gov/recarea/siuslaw/recreation/recarea/?recid=42465" target="_blank">Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area</a>. Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area has adventurous and fun dunes to explore in almost any all terrain vehicle you like. ATV's and UTV's are all great choices as you speed across the vast dunes. However, if you aren't as much as an adrenaline junkie you could always go to a Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area hiking expedition and explore the area on foot.</p>
